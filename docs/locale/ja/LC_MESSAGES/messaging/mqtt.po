"The primary mechanism that devices and applications use to communicate with "
"the IBM Internet of Things Foundation is MQTT; this is a protocol designed "
"for the efficient exchange of real-time data with sensor and mobile devices."

"MQTT runs over TCP/IP and, while it is possible to code directly to TCP/IP, "
"you might prefer to use a library that handles the details of the MQTT "
"protocol for you. You will find there's a wide range of MQTT client "
"libraries available at mqtt.org_, with the best place to start looking being"
" the `Eclipse Paho project`_. IBM contributes to the development and support"
" of many of these libraries."

"OASIS Standard."

#: ..\docs\messaging\mqtt.rst:23
msgid ""
"One reason for using version 3.1.1 is that the maximum length of the MQTT "
"Client Identifier (ClientId) is increased from the 23 character limit "
"imposed by 3.1. The IoT service will often require longer ClientId's and "
"will accept long ClientId's with either version of the protocol however some"
" 3.1 client libraries check the ClientId and enforce the 23 character limit."

msgid ""
"The MQTT protocol provides three qualities of service for delivering "
"messages between clients and servers: \"at most once\", \"at least once\" "
"and \"exactly once\". Events and commands can be sent using any quality of "
"service level, however you should carefully consider whether what the right "
"level is for your needs.  It is not a simple case that QoS2 is \"better\" "
"than QoS0."

msgid "At most once (QoS0)"
msgstr ""

#: ..\docs\messaging\mqtt.rst:108
msgid ""
"The message is delivered at most once, or it might not be delivered at all. "
"Delivery across the network is not acknowledged, and the message is not "
"stored. The message could be lost if the client is disconnected, or if the "
"server fails. QoS0 is the fastest mode of transfer. It is sometimes called "
"\"fire and forget\"."
msgstr ""

#: ..\docs\messaging\mqtt.rst:114
msgid ""
"The MQTT protocol does not require servers to forward publications at QoS0 "
"to a client. If the client is disconnected at the time the server receives "
"the publication, the publication might be discarded, depending on the server"
" implementation."
msgstr ""

#: ..\docs\messaging\mqtt.rst:119
msgid ""
"When sending real-time data on an interval we recommend using QoS0.  If a "
"single message goes missing it does not really matter as another message "
"will be sent shortly after containing newer data.  In this scenario the "
"extra cost of using higher quality of service does not result in any "
"tangible benefit."

#: ..\docs\messaging\mqtt.rst:127
msgid ""
"The message is always delivered at least once. It might be delivered "
"multiple times if there is a failure before an acknowledgment is received by"
" the sender. The message must be stored locally at the sender, until the "
"sender receives confirmation that the message has been published by the "
"receiver. The message is stored in case the message must be sent again."

msgstr ""

#: ..\docs\messaging\mqtt.rst:136
msgid ""
"The message is always delivered exactly once. The message must be stored "
"locally at the sender, until the sender receives confirmation that the "
"message has been published by the receiver. The message is stored in case "
"the message must be sent again. QoS2 is the safest, but slowest mode of "
"transfer. A more sophisticated handshaking and acknowledgement sequence is "
"used than for QoS1 to ensure no duplication of messages occurs."

"When sending commands we recommend using QoS2.  In many cases, when "
"processing commands you want to know that the command will only be actioned,"

msgid ""
"Each subscription from either a device or application is allocated a buffer "
"of 5000 messages.  This allows for any application or device to fall behind "
"the live data it is processing and build up a backlog of up to 5000 pending "
"messages for each subscription it has made.  Once the buffer fills up, any "
"new message will result in the oldest message in the buffer being discarded."
msgstr ""

#: ..\docs\messaging\mqtt.rst:157
msgid ""
"The subscription buffer can be accessed using MQTT clean session option.  If"
" clean session is set to true, a subscriber will start receiving messages "
"from the buffer. If it is false the buffer is reset."
msgstr ""

#: ..\docs\messaging\mqtt.rst:161
msgid ""
"This limit applies regardless of the quality of service setting used. Thus "
"it is possible that a message sent at QoS1 or QoS2 may not be delivered to "
"an application that is unable to keep up with the messages rate for the "
"subscription(s) it has made."

==========================================================================

The `Internet of Things Foundation Quickstart service <https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com>`__ is a tool demonstrating how quickly and easily you can get devices connected with the Internet of Things Foundation. The Quickstart service can be used with a device or, if you don't have a device to hand, you can simulate a device using the `IoT Sensor <https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/iotsensor/>`__ application.

To connect to the Quickstart service, users must speak MQTT. MQTT 3.1 is the minimum level required, however, version 3.1.1 provides better functionality.

There are also several `programming guides <../libraries/programmingguides.html#/>`__ which you can use to connect to Quickstart in a language of your preference.

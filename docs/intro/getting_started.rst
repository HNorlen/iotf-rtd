Quickstart
==========================================================================

The Internet of Things Foundation Quickstart service is a tool demonstrating how quickly and easily you can get devices connected with the Internet of Things Foundation. The Quickstart service can be used with a device or, if you don't have a device to hand, you can simulate a device using the `IoT Sensor <https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/iotsensor/>`__ application.

To connect to the Quickstart service, users must speak MQTT. MQTT 3.1 is the minimum level required, however, version 3.1.1 provides better functionality.

There are also several programming guides which you can use to connect to Quickstart in a language of your preference, you can find documentation for them `here <../libraries/programmingguides.html#/>`__.

Device Management Protocol
============================

The Device Management Protocol is used for device management communication between the device management agent and the device management server as a part of the Internet of Things Foundation. It is based on MQTT but uses a different set of topics to the regular device messaging protocol used for unmanaged device communication. 

The management agent on a device must implement the device management protocol in order to enable management by the Internet of Things Foundation. The management agent may be packaged as an enhanced MQTT client, or written using an MQTT library. 

Message Format
---------------

All messages are sent in JSON format over MQTT. There are two types of message.

1. Requests.
	Requests are formatted as follows:
	.. code::

		{
			"d": {...},
			"reqId": ...
		}
	
	These messages must include two JSON elements, "d" and "reqId". The "d" field carries the data relevant to the request, and the "reqId" field is an identifier of the request, and must be copied into a response. If a response is not required, the field should be omitted.
	
2. Response.
	Responses are formatted as follows:
	
	.. code::

		{
			"rc": ...,
			"message": ...,
			"d": {...},
			"reqId": ...
		}
	
	These messages can include include four JSON elements: "rc", "message", "d", and "reqId". The "rc" field is a result code of the original request, the "message" field is an optional field with a text description of the response code, "d" is a data field accompanying the response, if necessary, and "reqId" is the request ID of the original request. The "reqId" field is used to correlate responses with requests, and the device needs to ensure that all request IDs are unique.
	
	When responding to Internet of Things Foundation requests, the correct "reqId" value must be sent in the response.
	

MQTT Client Configuration
--------------------------

Quality of Service Levels and CleanSession
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Devices can send messages with Quality of Service (QoS) level of 0 or 1. If QoS 1 is used, messages from the device will be queued is necessary. Messages from the device must not be retained messages. The Internet of Things Foundation publishes requests with a QoS level of 1 o support queuing messages.

In order to queue messages sent while a device is not connected, the device should use cleansession=false. Otherwise, cleansession=true should be used.

Topics
~~~~~~~~

Messages can originate from the Internet of Things Foundation, or on the device.

Messages originating on the device are published to topics with the prefix 'iotdevice-1' in the form:

.. code::

	iotdevice-1/...
	
Messages originating from the Internet of Things Foundation are published to topics with the prefix 'iotdm-1' in the form:

.. code::

	iotdm-1/...
	
Responses from the device must be published to:
.. code::

	iotdevice-1/response.

Responses from the Internet of Things Foundation will be published to:

.. code::

	iotdm-1/response.

Python Client Library - Internet of Things Foundation API Support
==========================================================================

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This client library describes how to use the Internet of Things Foundation Python client library with the Internet of Things Foundation API. For help with getting started with this module, see `Python Client Library - Introduction <https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iot-python>`__. 

This documentation contains information on how applications can use the `Python ibmiotf Client Library <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ibmiotf>`__ to interact with your organization in the IBM Internet of Things Foundation Connect through ReST APIs.

The `Python for Devices documentation </python_cli_for_devices.html>`__ contains information on how devices can publish events and handle commands using the Python ibmiotf Client Library. 

The `Python for Applications documentation </python_cli_for_apps.html>`__ contains information on how applications can use the Python ibmiotf Client Library to interact with devices.


Constructor
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Internet of Things Python module client is built for device, application, or API use by the constructor. The constructor requires a properties object containing the following definitions:

* org - Your organization ID.
* auth-method - This defines the authentication method be used, and should always be set to "apikey".
* auth-key - The authentication key should be your API key.
* auth-token - The authentication token is your API key token.

These definitions are used to interact with the Internet of Things Foundation module. 

After installing the client library, as described in the Python for the Internet of Things Foundation Introduction, the APIClient instance can be construced by running the following code snippet:

.. code:: python
    
	import ibmiotf
	import ibmiotf.application

	apiOptions = {"org": "uguhsp", "id": "myapp", "auth-method": "apikey", "auth-key": "SOME KEY", "auth-token": "SOME TOKEN"}
	apiCli = ibmiotf.api.ApiClient(apiOptions)
        

----

Response and Exception
----------------------

Each method in the APIClient responds with either a valid response (JSON or boolean) in the case of success or IoTFCReSTException in the case of failure. The IoTFCReSTException contains the following properties that application can parse to get more information about the failure.

* httpcode - HTTP Status Code
* message - Exception message containing the reason for the failure
* response - JsonElement containing the partial response if any otherwise null

So in the case of failure, application needs to parse the response to see if the action is partially successful or not.

----

Organization details
----------------------------------------------------

Applications can use the getOrganizationDetails() method to retrieve the Organization details. Add the following code to a .py file, beneath the constructor code shown above.

.. code:: Python

    orgDetail = apiCli.getOrganizationDetails();

Refer to the Organization Configuration section of the `IBM IoT Foundation API <https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/swagger/v0002.html>`__ for information about the request & response model and http status code.

Sample
~~~~~~~

Your final code should follow this format:

.. code:: python
    
	import ibmiotf
	import ibmiotf.application

	apiOptions = {"org": "uguhsp", "id": "myapp", "auth-method": "apikey", "auth-key": "SOME KEY", "auth-token": "SOME TOKEN"}
	apiCli = ibmiotf.api.ApiClient(apiOptions)
	
	orgDetail = apiCli.getOrganizationDetails();

----

Bulk device operations
----------------------------------------------------

Applications can use bulk operations to get, add or remove devices in bulk from Internet of Things Foundation Connect.

Refer to the Bulk Operations section of the `IBM IoT Foundation API https://docs.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/swagger/v0002.html#!/Bulk_Operations/>`__ for information about the list of query parameters, the request & response model and http status code.

Retrieve device information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Bulk device information can be retrieved using the getAllDevices() method. This method retrieves all registered devices in the organization from Internet of Things Foundation Connect, each request can contain a maximum of 512KB. 

.. code:: python

    response = apiClient.getAllDevices();
    

The response contains parameters and application needs to retrieve the dictionary *results* from the response to get the array of devices returned. Other parameters in the response are required to make further call, for example, the *_bookmark* element can be used to page through results. Issue the first request without specifying a bookmark, then take the bookmark returned in the response and provide it on the request for the next page. Repeat until the end of the result set indicated by the absence of a bookmark. Each request must use exactly the same values for the other parameters, or the results are undefined.

In order to pass the *_bookmark* or any other condition, the overloaded method must be used. The overloaded method takes the parameters in the form of org.apache.http.message.BasicNameValuePair as shown below,

.. code:: python

	import ibmiotf
	import ibmiotf.application
    
        ...
    
        try:
	    apiOptions = {"org": "uguhsp", "id": "myapp", "auth-method": "apikey", "auth-key": "SOME KEY", "auth-token": "SOME TOKEN"}
	    apiCli = ibmiotf.api.ApiClient(apiOptions)
    
            ...
	    print("Retrieved Devices = ", apiCli.getAllDevices({'typeId' : deviceTypeId}))		


Register Devices in bulk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Method addMultipleDevices() can be used to register one or more devices to Internet of Things Foundation Connect, each request can contain a maximum of 512KB. For example, the following sample shows how to add a device using the bulk operation.


.. code:: python

	import ibmiotf
	import ibmiotf.application
    
        ...
    
        try:
	    apiOptions = {"org": "uguhsp", "id": "myapp", "auth-method": "apikey", "auth-key": "SOME KEY", "auth-token": "SOME TOKEN"}
	    apiCli = ibmiotf.api.ApiClient(apiOptions)
    
            ...
            print("\nBulk Registering new devices 4")	
            listOfDevices = [{'typeId' : deviceTypeId, 'deviceId' : '200020002004'}, {'typeId' : deviceTypeId, 'deviceId' : '200020002005'}]
            print("Registered Device = ", apiCli.addMultipleDevices(listOfDevices))

    
The response will contain the generated authentication tokens for all devices. Application must make sure to record these tokens when processing the response. The Internet of Things Foundation will not able to retrieve lost authentication tokens. 

Delete Devices in bulk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Method deleteMultipleDevices() can be used to delete multiple devices from Internet of Things Foundation Connect, each request can contain a maximum of 512KB. For example, the following sample shows how to delete 2 devices using the bulk operation.



.. code:: python

	import ibmiotf
	import ibmiotf.application
    
        ...
    
        try:
	    apiOptions = {"org": "uguhsp", "id": "myapp", "auth-method": "apikey", "auth-key": "SOME KEY", "auth-token": "SOME TOKEN"}
	    apiCli = ibmiotf.api.ApiClient(apiOptions)
            ...
            print("\nDeleting bulk devices")
            listOfDevices = [ {'typeId' : deviceTypeId, 'deviceId' : '200020002004'}, {'typeId' : deviceTypeId, 'deviceId' : '200020002005'} ]
            deleted = apiCli.deleteMultipleDevices(listOfDevices)
            print("Device deleted = ", deleted)

.. code:: python

     print("Retrieved Device = ", apiCli.getDeviceType("myDeviceType5"))

    
Update a Device Type
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Method updateDeviceType() can be used to modify one or more properties of a device type. The properties that needs to be modified should be passed in the form of a dictionary, as shown below

.. code:: python
    
     print("\nUpdating a device type")
     description = "mydescription"
     metadata2 = {"customField1": "customValue3", "customField2": "customValue4"}
     deviceInfo = {"serialNumber": "string", "manufacturer": "string", "model": "string", "deviceClass": "string", "fwVersion": "string", "hwVersion": "string","descriptiveLocation": "string"}
